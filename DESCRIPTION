Description: This package performs classical correspondence analysis (CA) and
     simultaneous analysis (SA). Simultaneous analysis is a factorial
     methodology developed for the joint treatment of a set of several
     contingency tables. In SA tables having the same rows, are concatenated 
     row-wise.
     In this version of the package a multiple option have been included for 
     the simultaneous analysis
     of tables having the same columns, concatenated column-wise.
     This way, a MSA allows to perform the analysis of an indicator matrix 
     where the rows represent individuals.
     In this package, functions for computation, summaries
     and graphical visualization in two dimensions are provided, including
     options to display partial and supplementary points.
